## My Music Tastes

## Description
This html and css website displays information related to my favorite musical artists. 
All rankings are based upon the data produced by Last.FM, a real-time music analyzation
tool. It captures cool data on when and how much music you listen to. For the website, 
I displayed the top 8 artists that I listen to on one page, with the number of albums
and total songs listened to. The other page includes my top 10 listened to songs in 
the past 5 years.
